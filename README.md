# Master-Station-Log
A Master Station Log or Help Desk Ticket tool used on a standalone network. This was created due to having no ticketing system, no external Internet access, and no Access or other database program. We had Word, Excel and Powerpoint and at the start were using Excel to manually input work, tasks, and tickets. I created this, first using excel as a database but figured out I could use the MS Jet ODBC via VBscript to create and manipulate access databases with SQL. Over time this became a fully fledged ticket and logging system. I was working on more advanced features but we ended up finally getting a Sharepoint server and MS SQL database server. It still works on Windows 11 so maybe someone would find it useful. Feel free to use it or pieces of it for whatever. I make no guarantees of it's functionality or safety so use at your own risk.
